    <string name="about">This app is for calculating average fuel consumption of vehicles. It can
        calculate l/100 km, km/l and mpg. For addition there is an average speed calculator, which
        uses time and distance travelled to calculate the average speed and a speedometer which uses
        GPS data to calculate speed.
    </string>

    <string name="settings">Settings</string>
    <string name="settings_text">Lets select which units to use for distance, amount, consumption
        and speed. It saves data to database. If \"Restore defaults\" is clicked, default units are
        used for distance (km), amount (litres), consumption (l/100km) and speed (km/h).
    </string>

    <string name="afcc">Average Fuel Consumption Calculator</string>
    <string name="afcc_text">Allows to calculate average fuel consumption based on distance travelled
        and amount of fuel consumed. It uses units set in settings. \"Calculate\" button initializes the
        calculation, \"Save\" button saves result to database and \"Saved Results\" shows previously
        saved results.
    </string>

    <string name="previous_results">Saved Results</string>
    <string name="previous_results_text">Shows previously saved results as a list with date when the
        result was saved. When long-clicked on the list item, alert view appears to allow deletion of
        that result.

    <string name="average_speed_calculator">Average Speed Calculator</string>
    <string name="average_speed_calculator_text">Calculates average speed based on distance and time
        taken. It uses distance unit set in settings. Start and end times are set using time pickers.
        \"Calculate\" button initializes the calculation of average speed.
    </string>

    <string name="speedometer_text">Shows current speed based on device\'s GPS data. Uses speed unit
        that was set in settings.
